  question: What component of an electric vehicle recovers energy when braking, helping
    to extend its range?
  answers:

  - Battery
  - Regenerative Brake
  - Exhaust System

    the energy usually lost as heat during braking. This energy is then used to recharge
    the battery, extending the vehicle's range.
